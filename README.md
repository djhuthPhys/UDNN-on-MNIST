# UDNN-on-MNIST

This repository contains files for loading MNIST data into numpy arrays ('NN_image_prep.py'), deforming those images with elastic deformations for increasing data set size ('deform_images.py'), and implementing an 'Ultra Dense' Neural Network ('UDNN_MNIST_utils.py'), a feed forward network similar to convolutional DenseNets. 

Dependencies:
  'UDNN_MNIST_utils.py' is dependent on the other two files for proper execution
